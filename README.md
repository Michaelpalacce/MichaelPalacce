# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### My name is Stefan Genov. Professionally I am a PHP Developer / System Administrator.

### Even though professionally I work as a PHP developer I have a passion for Nodejs and have written multiple modules:

- https://www.npmjs.com/package/server-emulator ( Check this one out! You can emulate your File System in the browser. You can easily transfer files or watch movies, listen to videos or just browse pictures. It also has a terminal built in so if you install this on a linux machine you can execute commands. All in the browser! )

- https://www.npmjs.com/package/fs-browser
