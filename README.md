# Hi there 👋

### My name is Stefan Genov. Professionally I am a Senior PHP Developer / System Administrator. I maintain all the servers/chef recipes and databases of my company for the project my team is responsible for.

### I have proficient exprience with PHP, Frontend Stuff ( hooray HTML and CSS ), Javascript, Nodejs, Chef, Cassandra, Python. I have in depth knowledge of the linux system, most notable CentOS.

### Even though professionally I work as a PHP developer I have a passion for Nodejs and have written multiple modules:

- https://www.npmjs.com/package/event_request ( NodeJS Web framework )

- https://www.npmjs.com/package/server-emulator ( Check this one out! You can emulate your File System in the browser. You can easily transfer files or watch movies, listen to videos or just browse pictures. It also has a terminal built in so if you install this on a linux machine you can execute commands. All in the browser! )

- https://www.npmjs.com/package/fs-browser

- https://www.npmjs.com/package/er_memcached_data_server

- https://www.npmjs.com/package/er_redis_data_server

- 🔭 I’m currently working on https://github.com/Michaelpalacce/EventRequest ( and plugins for it ), a fast and highly customizable webframework for NodeJS.
- 🌱 I’m constantly trying to improve my knowledge on any language I know or don't know.

- 😄 Pronouns: He/His.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I was enrolled in lets say a student's program where I had no knowledge of web development ( half a year of embedded development ) and was told I shouldn't waste my time by the organiser. After 2 months when the program finished I was called by that same organiser because he wanted to make smaller teams to focus on different projects of theirs and I was to be the PHP "lead". A day later I left that program to start work at my current job ( To heck with you organiser! ).
